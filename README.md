- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sironix 
- 👀 I’m interested in fighting games. thirdparty extensions to games (for example randomizers for rpg games, or things like that)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua for coding, also anatomy for drawing and trying to find a good game engine that could work on my current setup.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything hype honestly. (but I'm not sure of how much help I would be at the moment)
