- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sironix 
- 👀 I’m interested in fighting games. thirdparty extensions to games (for example randomizers for rpg games, or things like that)
- 🌱 I tend to change quite a bit of what I'm doing and learning, currently learning godot and making games on it, once I get the hang of it I'll probably start messing with c++ or c.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything hype honestly. (but I'm not sure of how much help I would be at the moment)
<!--- - 📫 How to reach me
